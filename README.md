# basic_tkinter
Tkinter is a built-in package in Python that allows you to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A GUI is a way for people to interact with a program using visual elements like windows, buttons, and menus, instead of just text. Tkinter makes it easy to use the Tk toolkit, which is a system for creating GUIs that comes with Python.
